# MEDIA-DICTIONARY-Cpp
A simple C++ program that acts as a media-related dictionary. Users can input media terms, and the program will provide their definitions. The program uses a while loop for continuous user interaction, if-else statements for term matching, and string conversion to handle case insensitivity.
